          <h2>Defining the Front-end Developer Role</h2>

          <p>
            Fundamentally a front-end developer, historically sometimes refereed
            to as a client-side developer, produces the code sent from a web
            server to a client/front-end, to establish a user interface. For
            example, when you load a webpage into a web browser code is sent
            from a web server to the device/client requesting the page. The code
            sent will produce the user interface one sees in the web browser.
            This code is considered front-end code and is a mixture of the web
            technologies <a href="https://www.w3.org/html/">HTML</a>,
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">CSS</a>, and
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript"
              >JavaScript</a
            >.
          </p>

          <p>
            An individual typically enters into the field of front-end
            development by first learning to
            <a
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web"
            >
              development by first learning to build a simple website using HTML
              and CSS development by first learning to </a
            >. HTML or Hyper Text Markup Language is likened to the structural
            framing of a house while CSS or Cascading Style Sheets can be
            considered the finishing touches one sees once a home is complete.
          </p>

          <p>
            Eventually, the house (i.e., a website) will need to become
            automated. In other words, it will need to become interactive and
            respond to events orchestrated by the user or the device on which it
            runs (e.g., on click or on load do X). To accomplish this, front-end
            developers
            <a
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics"
              >learn the JavaScript programming language</a
            >
            and use this language and the Document Object Model (aka the DOM) to
            add dynamic and interactive aspects to HTML and CSS.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a front-end developer progresses in their career they will move
            from a simple understanding of web pages and web sites to
            potentially a robust grasp of
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_coding_practices"
              >software development practices</a
            >
            as it is done on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/bm/docs/Web">the web platfor</a h>m using the JavaScript programming
            language.

          <h2>Required Skills</h2>

            <p>
              HyperText Markup Language, commonly referred to as HTML, is the
              standard markup language used to create web pages. Web browsers
              can read HTML files and render them into visible or audible web
              pages. HTML describes the structure of a website semantically
              along with cues for presentation, making it a markup language,
              rather than a programming language.

            <p>
              Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
              describing the look and formatting of a document written in a
              markup language. Although most often used to change the style of
              web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the
              language can be applied to any kind of XML document, including
              plain XML, SVG and XUL. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a
              cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually
              engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user
              interfaces for many mobile applications.

              A uniform resource locator (URL) (also called a web address) is a

              A URL is a specific type of uniform resource identifier (URI),
              although many people use the two terms interchangeably. A URL
              implies the means to access an indicated resource, which is not
              true of every URI. URLs occur most commonly to reference web pages
              (http), but are also used for file transfer (ftp), email (mailto),
              database access (JDBC), and many other applications.

            <p>
              JavaScript is a high level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted
              programming language. It has been standardized in the ECMAScript
              language specification. Alongside HTML and CSS, it is one of the
              three essential technologies of World Wide Web content production;
              the majority of websites employ it and it is supported by all
              modern web browsers without plug-ins. JavaScript is
              prototype-based with first-class functions, making it a
              multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented, imperative,
              and functional programming styles. It has an API for working with
              text, arrays, dates and regular expressions, but does not include
              any I/O, such as networking, storage or graphics facilities,
              relying for these upon the host environment in which it is
              embedded.

              It is the primary data format used for asynchronous browser/server
              communication (AJAJ), largely replacing XML (used by AJAX).
              Although originally derived from the JavaScript scripting
              language, JSON is a language-independent data format. Code for
              parsing and generating JSON data is readily available in many
              programming languages. The JSON format was originally specified by
              Douglas Crockford. It is currently described by two competing
              standards, RFC 7159 and ECMA-404. The ECMA standard is minimal,
              describing only the allowed grammar syntax, whereas the RFC also
              provides some semantic and security considerations. The official
              Internet media type for JSON is application/json. The JSON
              filename extension is .json.

              accessible design ensures both “direct access” (i.e., unassisted)

              assistive technology (for example, computer screen readers).

            As of late defining the skills of a front-end developer has become
            complicated due to a significant divide in the front-end developer
            profession. A <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-great-divide/">gap has arisen between those front-end developer</a>s who
            focus on programming and becoming a traditional computer science
            oriented JavaScript/software developer, and all this entails, and
            those who focus more on the UI, HTML, CSS and happen to know some
            JavaScript. This gap for better or worse was orchestrated by the
            fact that JavaScript infiltrated the back-end and thus back-end
            developers in time found themselves writing JavaScript back-ends
            with tools like <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> and <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">mongoDB</a>. Eventually, these engineers
            infiltrated the front-end. The good news is this scenario resulted
            in a front-end and JavaScript renaissance. Pretty much, everything
            got better. Tools. Frameworks. Package Managers. Libraries. CSS. JavaScript. But, it
            especially got better for those who already had a command of the
            JavaScript programming language. The bad news this renaissance also
            diluted and complicated the skills required to do front-end
            development and has pulled the profession towards a more engineering
            focused field of work often requiring traditional computer science
            training and software development know-how over UI experience.
            Unfortunately, for the time being, getting a front-end developer job
            today might come down to how much you know about computer science
            theory, software development, or the specifics parts of the
            ECMAScript specification. I say unfortunately because, in my
            opinion, what is more important than these matters is a robust
            understanding of how to construct a usable touch point between the
            user and the code.
          </p>

          <p>
            Simultaneously, a trend has been occurring for several years now
            where websites and web applications are being built using a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_client">thick/fat client architecture</a> (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">Single Page Applications or SPA's</a>). Meaning, what was once mostly done on
            the server is now done in the client at runtime. In short, the
            application logic that runs a website or web application will today
            often run in the client instead of on the server. When this
            architecture is in use, the data that drives the website or web
            application is requested at runtime by the client using a <a href="https://www.programmableweb.com/api-university">data API</a>
            (i.e., an interface that returns data only, typically in the form of
            <a href="https://www.json.org/">JSON</a>). What this means for the front-end developer profession is
            what was once consider back-end competencies are now becoming
            required competencies to do front-end development (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development">Software Development</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application_development">Web Application Development</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_build">Software Build Processes</a>,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(computer_science)">State management</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_performance_management">Application performance</a>, etc).
          </p>

          <p>
            Due to the divide mentioned above and the movement towards thick/fat
            applications in the client, the front-end skill set spectrum is
            currently being stretch by what is known as a full-stack developer.
            A full-stack developer can supposedly not only code a front-end
            application UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for multiple screen
            sizes but can also develop the database and data API as well as the
            web server serving the client. It is this authors opinion that this
            jack of all development trades has been seen before in the form of a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webmaster">webmaster</a> and <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/">back-end framework developers</a>. The author believes that history
            will repeat itself and the notion of a single do it all developer
            will run its course again and then eventually be wisely replaced
            with reasonably focused developers either working mainly on the
            front-end or back-end with a clear separation. I believe this will
            happen because the mile wide and inch deep developer is ultimately
            inept at properly caring for the UI and user experience. Don't get
            me wrong, a one in a million, unicorn, rock star developer, does
            exist. But modeling a profession on such an individual is
            impractical.

            As I just mentioned, a great
            <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-great-divide/">divide</a> has
            been brewing in the front-end developer space for several years
            between two very different types of front-end developers. On the one
            side, you have JavaScript-focused programmers who write JavaScript
            for front-end runtimes that likely have computer science skills with
            a software development history. They probably view HTML and CSS as
            an abstraction (i.e.,
            <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html">JSX</a> and
            <a
              href="https://hackernoon.com/all-you-need-to-know-about-css-in-js-984a72d48ebc"
              >CSS in JS</a
            >). On the other side, you have, most likely, non-computer science
            educated developers who focus on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as it
            specifically pertains to the UI. When entering or trying to
            understand the front-end developer space, you will absolutely feel
            this divide. The term front-end developer is on the verge of
            meaninglessness without clarifying words to address what type of
            front-end developer is being discussed.

              >hard</a
            >). The common, or most used (i.e., generic), title for a front-end
            developer is, "front-end developer" or "front-end engineer". Note
            that any job that contains the word "front-end", "client-side", "web
            UI", "HTML", "CSS", or "JavaScript" typically infers that a person
            has some degree of HTML, CSS, DOM, and JavaScript professional
            know-how.

          <p>

              >Front-End Developer/Engineer (Previously called Client-side
              Developer)</strong
            >: The generic job title that describes a developer who is skilled
            to some degree at HTML, CSS, DOM, and JavaScript and implementing
            these technologies on the web platform (URLs, HTTP, Browsers, Web
            APIs, etc).
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Application/JavaScript Developer/Engineer</strong>: The job
            title given to a developer who comes from a computer science,
            engineering, background and is using these skills to work with
            front-end technologies. This role typically requires computer
            science knowledge and years of software development experience. When
            the word "JavaScript Application" is included in the job title, this
            will denote that the developer should be an advanced JavaScript
            developer possessing advanced programming, software development, and
            application development skills (i.e has years of experience building
            front-end software applications). In all likely hood if the words
            engineer, JavaScript, or full-stack appear in the job title this
            will entail server-side JavaScript (i.e. Node.js, MongoDB, etc).

          <p>
            <strong>Front-End Performance Developer/Engineer </strong>: The job
            title given to a JavaScript Application Engineer or UI Developer who
            is focused on the performance implications of JavaScript and
            JavaScript runtimes.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>CSS/HTML Developer</strong>: The front-end job title that
            describes a developer who is skilled at HTML and CSS, excluding
            JavaScript and Application know-how.

          <h2>Overlapping Disciplines</h2>
          <p>
            A front-end developer will often work on a web development team
            containing the following roles:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Project Lead / Product owner (i.e., stakeholder, project manager,
              etc.)
            </li>
            <li>
              Visual Designer (i.e., fonts, colors, spacing, emotion, visual
              concepts &amp; themes)
            </li>
            <li>
              UI/Interaction Designer (i.e., wireframes, specifying all user
              interactions and UI functionality, structuring information)
            </li>
            <li>
              Front-End Developer (i.e., writes code that runs on the client or
              front-end)
            </li>
            <li>
              Back-End Developer (i.e., writes code that runs on the server)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The five roles just mentioned can overlap each other. For example, a
            front-end developer will typically have a good handle on
            UI/Interaction design as well as Back-end development. Additionally,
            it is not uncommon to find a Visual Designer who does Interaction
            Design and can also contribute to front-end coding efforts.
          </p>
          <p>
            A larger web development team might include the following roles not
            mentioned above:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>SEO Strategists</li>
            <li>Developer Operations Engineers (aka DevOp Engineers)</li>
            <li>Performance Engineers</li>
            <li>API Developers</li>
            <li>Database Administrators (aka DBA's)</li>
            <li>QA Engineers / Testers</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

          <h2>Compensation</h2>
          <p>
            The national average in the U.S for a mid-level front-end developer
            is somewhere between

          <p>
            Of course when you first enter into the profession expect to enter
            the field at around 40k a year depending upon location and
            experience.
          </p>

          <p>
            A lead/senior/principle front-end developer/engineer can potentially

          <h2>Occupational Challenges</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Front-end developer training and education is still a complicated
              endeavor, and those who break into the occupation often have done
              so by pure determination and self-directed learning resources.
            </li>
            <li>
              Front-end developers have to write code that will support a user
              interface on an extensive spectrum of device types and screen
              sizes.
            </li>
            <li>
              While not as complex of a problem as it once was front-end
              developers still have to write code that will run in several
              different browsers.
            </li>
            <li>
              Front-end developers are expected not only to be highly skilled at
              user interface design and interaction design but also at the
              practice of computer programming, computer science, and software
              engineering.
            </li>
            <li>
              Front-end developers have to ride the wave of changing
              technologies, specifications, frameworks, and tools. This moving
              foundation has implications not only on an individual's skills but
              additionally on how easy it is to switch jobs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Front-end developers not only have to be experts at HTML, CSS, and
              JavaScript but also experts at complicated dialects of these
              languages (JSX, Markdown, Stylus, Less, SASS, TypeScript, Reason,
              PureScript, etc.). They are potentially learning six languages,
              which is far more difficult than learning just three (i.e. HTML,
              CSS, JavaScript).
            </li>
            <li>
              Front-end developers have to deal with non-trivial areas of
              complexity such as font rendering, search engine optimizations,
              accessibility standards, web security (e.g. SSL, OAuth2, XSS), image optimizations, network performance,
              HTML email, browser performance, JavaScript performance, HTML,
              CSS, and DOM rendering, and divergent JavaScript runtimes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Front-end developers today are dealing with the implications of
              trying to do all things on a platform that was initially designed
              to be a static document viewer. Real-time. Applications.
              Animation. Video games. The web has to be all things. And all
              things is very hard on front-end developers given that the web is
              viewed through a user-determined device, using a user-determined
              application, over a user-determined network. It is hard to do all
              the things when code has to account for a complicated spectrum of
              user-determined variables.
            </li>
            <li>
              Front-end developers today are stuck in an evolving job situation
              where a professional aptitude for UI design, software
              architecture, interaction design, and back-end/server-side
              programming can be placed on the front-end developer. Essentially,
              unrealistic expectations are being placed on front-end developers
              to operate at a professional level anywhere in the development
              stack while also being proficient at user interface development.
